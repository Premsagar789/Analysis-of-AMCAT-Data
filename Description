Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the data-set given below. Consider Salary as a target variable. You should submit a Jupyter Notebook(i.e. .ipynb file) along with a 5 Page report in Innomatics Report Template. Zip both the files together and upload on LMS.

If you are facing any difficulty in performing EDA, follow the steps mentioned below:

Step - 1 - Introduction -> Give a detailed data description and objective
Step - 2 - Import the data and display the head, shape and description of the data.
Step - 3 - Univariate Analysis -> PDF, Histograms, Boxplots, Countplots, etc..
Find the outliers in each numerical column
Understand the probability and frequency distribution of each numerical column
Understand the frequency distribution of each categorical Variable/Column
Mention observations after each plot.
Step - 4 - Bivariate Analysis
Discover the relationships between numerical columns using Scatter plots, hexbin plots, pair plots, etc..
Identify the patterns between categorical and numerical columns using swarmplot, boxplot, barplot, etc..
Identify relationships between categorical and categorical columns using stacked bar plots.
Mention observations after each plot.
Step - 5 - Research Questions
Times of India article dated Jan 18, 2019 states that “After doing your Computer Science Engineering if you take up jobs as a Programming Analyst, Software Engineer, Hardware Engineer and Associate Engineer you can earn up to 2.5-3 lakhs as a fresh graduate.” Test this claim with the data given to you.
Is there a relationship between gender and specialization? (i.e. Does the preference of Specialisation depend on the Gender?)
Step - 6 - Conclusion
Step - 7 - (Bonus) Come up with some interesting conclusions or research questions (such as step-5).
NOTE: Mention observations after each plot.



The dataset was released by Aspiring Minds from the Aspiring Mind Employment Outcome 2015 (AMEO). The study is primarily limited  only to students with engineering disciplines. The dataset contains the employment outcomes of engineering graduates as dependent variables (Salary, Job Titles, and Job Locations) along with the standardized scores from three different areas – cognitive skills, technical skills and personality skills. The dataset also contains demographic features. The dataset  contains  around  40 independent variables and 4000 data points. The independent variables are both continuous and categorical in nature. The dataset contains a unique identifier for each candidate. Below mentioned table contains the details for the original dataset.
